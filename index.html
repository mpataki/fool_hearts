          Fool Hearts is a project 10 years in the making.
          <br />
          Be it on stage, in studio, or around a kitchen table, we've amassed countless hours playing music together, and a formidable repertoire spanning decades.
          <br />
          <br />
          We specialize in weddings and corporate events but found our legs in clubs, bars, backyards, and barns.

              "Fool hearts was the perfect choice for our reception. We had a large family wedding and they had everyone on the dance floor all night. They played a whole range of hits that captured every era and kept the energy high whenever they were playing. They were a seven piece band that rotated singers and that really allowed them to do an amazing job on all the songs they play. We got all kinds of compliments on the band and family members were saying t was the most fun wedding they’ve been to in 20 years!  Hiring Fool Hearts was like getting an easy button for our wedding music. We couldn’t have been any happier with them!"

              "This band was the best part of our reception. Months later we have continued to hear from our family and friends as to how amazing and talented the Fool Hearts were, and how much fun they had at our wedding as a result. This band learned many songs that we requested, and even took the time to ask us for input on the arrangement of our first dance song. They also allowed us to use their P.A. which was perfect for speeches. This was the best money spent on our wedding. We were so happy to see that the dance floor was completely full the entire night. Thank-you to the entire Fool Hearts crew for an unforgettable night. We feel as though you are now an extended part of the Mayo/Crawford family!"

              "Fool Hearts were the perfect fit for our corporate holiday party! The band was easy to work with from the get go, were diligent in setting up, and were flexible in accommodating our event schedule. The band read the audience well and knew when it was time to switch the mood from jazz to more upbeat numbers. The music was so great, I think they may have been the first band to get our employees up on their feet and dancing! I would highly recommend Fool Hearts for weddings and corporate events."

They were open and enthusiastic working with us to choose the music, and true professionals from the moment we booked them through till the end of the night. They learned a new song for our first dance and it was so perfect and romantic. They got all of our guests on to the dance floor (even including Grandma) and kept everyone dancing all night. Our guests have not stopped raving about them and we were told by many people that it was the best wedding entertainment they had ever experienced. We could not have been happier and can't wait to see them play again!"

Their amazing music made the party "epic," "amazing," and "the new standard on the lake," as quoted by some of our guests.
