<h2>What style of music do you play?</h2>
  Our repertoire pulls from 60’s and 70’s rock, motown, 90’s rock and pop, and contemporary hits. We play the music we grew up with, and the music we love.

<h2>How loud will the band be?</h2>
  Maintaining a reasonable volume for a given room and crowd is one of our top considerations from the moment a gig is booked. It effects everything from the band members we bring, the songs we play, and the gear we play with. We will keep the volume appropriate, and exactly where you want it. 

<h2>What will happen between the band’s sets?</h2>
  There are a few options. We will bring a well stocked iPod which we are happy to plug in a play while the band takes breaks. We will also bring a jack for your own music device, should you be inclined to use it. Lastly, in the past, some couples have hired a DJ take over between sets - even better. We just ask that we be given contact info for the DJ or DJ company so that we can avoid playing each other’s songs. 

<h2>Do you take requests?</h2>
  Absolutely yes - in fact, we have a form over here for just that purpose! If you know ahead of time that you’re going to want something, let us know and we will learn it. We also don’t mind if people make requests on the night, although they can sometimes be harder to fulfill - but we will do our best!

<h2>Do we need to feed the band?</h2>
  Generally yes. Allowing the band a meal means that we won’t be leaving the site for any reason. That way we are guaranteed to be where we are supposed to be when the time comes, or if we are unexpectedly needed.

<h2>Can we borrow a microphone for announcements and/or speeches?</h2>
  Yes! Although when it comes to speeches, it’s worth talking to the venue first, as they often provide a podium and sound system for this purpose. Also, depending on the the venue / floor plan, an additional PA may be required for the speeches, which would come with a small additional cost. As for announcements, your MC is welcome to use a microphone from the stage if they would like.

<h2>Can we audition the band?</h2>
  Yeah! We play around Toronto regularly, and would be happy to audition for you at one of these public events. Let us know that you are coming and we’ll be sure to put your name on the guest list.

<h2>Will you play my first dance, or any other special dances?</h2>
  We would be honoured. Let us know what song(s) you want and we’ll make sure it’s perfect.

<h2>Will the band provide lighting?</h2>
  Generally yes, although it depends on the venue. We generally bring one rack of lights at minimum, but again, if you have specific requests, we’d love to hear them.
