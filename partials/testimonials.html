	<h2>Michelle and Frank Wilson - Private Birthday Party</h2>
	"Thanks to Phil, Mike and the other bandmates, having Fool Hearts play at our birthday party made all the difference. Their amazing music made the party "epic", "amazing" and "the new standard on the lake", as quoted by some of our guests. I look forward to seeing them play again soon and would be happy to recommend them to anyone who is looking for a lively, fun and interactive band."

	<h2>Angela Smolders - Paddy Flaherty's Pub</h2>
	"Fool Hearts is one of our favourite regular bands that we book at Paddy Flaherty's. Always entertaining and engaging with the crowd and always a very cool repertoire of music. It is always a pleasure to have them at the pub and will continue to book them for as long as they want to come back!"

	<h2>Jamie and Jenny Emberley - Wedding Clients</h2>
	"I would just like to say once again that you guys blew us and everyone attending the wedding away in terms of expectations with your performance! We could not have asked for anything more perfect and hope you guys enjoyed yourself as well. You guys are really talented. The band was getting so many compliments from everyone throughout the night, I had people coming up to us telling us it was the best party and wedding ever! Again, Thanks a million! I had a smile on my face the entire night."
