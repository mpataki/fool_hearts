	"The music was fabulous, and you had everyone dancing all night long; you even managed to get the groom on stage. Our guests kept telling us how much they loved the band; one guest called you the best band he'd ever heard at a wedding. We could honestly not have asked for a better night."

	"Thanks to Phil, Mike, and the other bandmates, having Fool Hearts play at our birthday party made all the difference. Their amazing music made the party "epic," "amazing," and "the new standard on the lake," as quoted by some of our guests. I look forward to seeing them play again soon and would be happy to recommend them to anyone who is looking for a lively, fun, and interactive band."

	"One of our favourite regular bands that we book at Paddy Flaherty's. Always entertaining and engaging with the crowd and always a very cool repertoire of music. It is always a pleasure to have them at the pub we and will continue to book them for as long as they want to come back!"

	"I would just like to say once again that you guys blew us and everyone attending the wedding away with your performance! We could not have asked for anything better and hope you guys enjoyed yourself as well. You guys are really talented. The band was getting so many compliments from everyone throughout the night; I had people coming up to us telling us it was the best party and wedding ever! Again, thanks a million! I had a smile on my face the entire night."

	"What better than a group of multi-talented musicians with a good ear for song selection to keep the vibe going? I hired the band to kick my event to the next level â€” they did so and more. People have been praising that night and how perfect the band was for my space. I need them back as soon as possible!"
