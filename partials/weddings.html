	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[0]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[0] = true">1. How many sets would you like us to play, and how long do you want them?</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[0]}">
	Most couples want 3 sets about 45 minutes to an hour in length, but we’re happy to play as much as you want. We’re pretty into that kind of thing.
	</div>

	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[1]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[1] = true">2. Would you also like us to play your ceremony?</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[1]}">
	In addition to bringing the party, we also bring the soft and pretty. In the past we have provided ceremonies with acoustic guitar instrumental music, soft male and / or female vocals, and even some more traditional piano music. Add a beautiful bride, and there won’t be a dry eye in the place.
	</div>

	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[2]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[2] = true">3. Would you like us to play any special dances?</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[2]}">
	We would be honoured. Let us know what songs you want and we’ll make sure they are perfect.
	</div>

	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[3]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[3] = true">4. Would you like us to provide house music between sets?</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[3]}">
	We are happy to provide music for between sets, just let us know what you’d like to hear, otherwise we’ll make an educated guess. If you have a DJ, kindly pass along some contact information so we can share our song choices. That way you don’t end up hearing the same song more than once.
	</div>

	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[4]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[4] = true">5. Do you need a sound system for the speeches, or during the ceremony?</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[4]}">
	We provide our own sound system for most occasions. If you need a system for your ceremony and/or speeches, venue permitting, we are happy to provide you with ours.
	</div>

	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[5]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[5] = true">6. Some logistics with the hall.</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[5]}">
	Things always run more smoothly if we can chat with the hall ahead of time about things like electrical power, space, etc. Just pass along the name of the hall and we’ll work it all out with them.
	</div>

	<div class="wedItem invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[6]}" in-view="CheckboxItemInView[6] = true">7. A couple of things that are nice to have:</div>
	<div class="invisible" ng-class="{visible: CheckboxItemInView[6]}">
	If you are putting an <i>itinerary</i> together for yourself or other vendors, we would love a copy. That way we know where to be and when without needing to ask. Also, we like to get to the hall nice and early so we can test our gear without disturbing anyone, but this means that we’ll need to know where you want us. If your preparations includes a <i>floor plan</i>, a copy would be great, even if it's just a rough sketch.
