			<i>Fool Hearts</i> is a project almost <i>10 years</i> in the making. Be it on stage, in studio, or around a kitchen table, we've amassed countless hours playing music together, and a <i>formidable repertoire spanning decades</i>.

			We specialize in <i>weddings</i> and <i>corporate events</i>, but found our legs in <i>clubs</i>, <i>bars</i>, <i>backyards</i>, and <i>barns</i>.

		<i>We accommodate you</i> and your budget. If it’s a large event, we’ll bring the whole team - horns, keys, amps, drums and all. If it’s a small private party, we'll be as small as a single member with an acoustic guitar. 
		<p>Regardless, <i>we’ll bring the party</i>.
