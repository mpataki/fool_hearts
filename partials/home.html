		<i>Fool Hearts</i> is a project almost <b>10 years</b> in the making. Be it on stage, in studio, or around a kitchen table, we've amassed countless hours playing music together, and a <b>formidable repertoire spanning decades</b>.

		We specialize in <b>weddings</b> and <b>corporate events</b>, but found our legs in <b>clubs</b>, <b>bars</b>, <b>backyards</b>, and <b>barns</b>.

		<b>We accommodate you</b> and your budget. If it’s a large event, we’ll bring the whole team - horns, keys, amps, drums and all. If it’s a small private party, we'll be as small as a single member with an acoustic guitar. 
		<p>Regardless, <b>we’ll bring the party</b>.
